        <h2>Phase 2: Expanding into the business you know today</h2>
        <p>
          The company quickly became a success, but was limited in where it
          could operate. After months of going to investors, the company finally
          gained enough capital to expand. After first opening a new branch in
          another town, business picked up until eventually the company was all
          over the world.
